# boom_arrow
A Minecraft mod for making arrows go boom.

To build this, for the sake of my sanity, I shall list what I did here:

1) Unzip the project into a directory
2) Open it in Intellij
3) From OUTSIDE Intellij, run the following gradle commands:
    - gradlew.bat genIntellijRuns
    - gradlew.bat build
4) Refresh the project in Intellij and hope for the best.
